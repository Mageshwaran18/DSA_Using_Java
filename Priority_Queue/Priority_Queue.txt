/**
 * Priority Queue in Java
 * 
 * A Priority Queue is a special type of queue where elements are processed based on their priority.
 * Java provides PriorityQueue class in java.util package.
 * 
 * Types:
 * 1. Min Priority Queue (default) - smallest element has highest priority
 * 2. Max Priority Queue - largest element has highest priority
 * 
 * Basic Syntax:
 * PriorityQueue<Type> pq = new PriorityQueue<>(); // Min PQ
 * PriorityQueue<Type> pq = new PriorityQueue<>(Collections.reverseOrder()); // Max PQ
 * 
 * Main Methods:
 * - add(E element) / offer(E element): Inserts element
 * - peek(): Returns head element without removing it
 * - poll(): Removes and returns head element
 * - remove(Object o): Removes specific element
 * - size(): Returns number of elements
 * - clear(): Removes all elements
 * - isEmpty(): Checks if queue is empty
 * 
 * Time Complexity:
 * - Insertion: O(log n)
 * - Deletion: O(log n)
 * - Peek: O(1)
 * 
 * Internal Implementation:
 * - Uses Binary Heap data structure
 * - Default initial capacity is 11
 * - Grows dynamically as elements are added
